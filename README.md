SnamlScript
===========

1 Introduction

SnamlScript is a HTML5 generator for Web applications. 

SnamlScript is similar to Tcl. It added block command and inline command to integrate the Tcl with HTML5 
for Web programming. SnamlScript code can generate a HTML5 web page and document. SnamlScript programs 
make a web site more maintainable, modifiable, and reusable with high-level consistence espcially for 0 
mobile web applications. In addition, SnamlScript is much easier to connect to a database and work along
with various javascript frameworks such as jQuery, AngularJS, .etc.

SnamlScript worked for multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux, MacOSX, .etc.

Neatware released SnamlScript as Open Source in Apache 2.0 License.
